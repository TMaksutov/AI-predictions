# AGENTS

This repository is maintained without human review. Follow these rules:

- Run `pytest` locally and ensure it passes before committing.
- Keep dependencies minimal and update `requirements.txt` when needed.
- Use 4-space indentation and simple, readable Python.
- Prefer common libraries over custom implementations.
- Keep code simple and avoid complex logic.
- Update tests and requirments.
- After committing push into `main`. I work alone.
- Update `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` whenever repository instructions change.
